SBuild Eclipse Plugin trunk:

* Detect changes of included resources and refresh all affected projects.
* Better error marker when buildfile could not be compiled. It not shows the
  concrete compiler error/waring and the correct line of the issue when the
  information is available (since SBuild 0.5.0.9004).

SBuild Eclipse Plugin 0.4.2 - 2013-06-07:

* Support for resolving/downloading sources and javadoc. This delegated the
  to a "source" and a "javadoc" scheme handler, which will be available since
  SBuild 0.4.0.9000 (trunk milestone).
* Show an Error Marker in Eclipse (Package Explorer, Problems View, Editor)
  for SBuild build file errors.
* Updates of the build file will now immediatly reflected in the classpath
  container. No more need to close/reopen the project.
* The SBuild Libraries entry in Package Explorer will be decorated with error
  messages, if downloading of some dependencies failed.

SBuild Eclipse Plugin 0.4.1 - 2013-04-29:

* Fixed issues with classpath container refreshes. Now, classpath changes are
  properly propagated to the Eclipse workspace.
* SBuild JARs are only loaded once and the classloader is shared, which will
  reduce memory consumption and improve speed (class loading and JIT compiler
  effects).
